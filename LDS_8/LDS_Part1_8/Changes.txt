We made some small changes in the python code "Creazione csv.py"of the first assignment. 

First we changed the values ​​of the quarter column of the Geography table from (1, 2, 3, 4) to (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4) for better readability of the data.

The most significant change was in the iscorrect column of the Answers table. We replaced "YES" and "NO" with 1 and 0, respectively 1 for "YES" and 0 for "NO". We chose to make this change to optimize the process for the second part's assignment 1.
